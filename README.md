# X-Ray Image classification using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

In this project we use Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to design a model that classifies X-ray images as “pneumonia” or “pneumonia-free”./
This is the final project for the CSML1020 course for the York University Certificate in Machine Learning Program.
